# CS106B
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the fall quarters 2016 version of the Stanford university course CS106B: Programming Abstractions. 

For more information about CS106B visit: http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172/

Note: The code in this repository needs the Stanford c++ library. To compile an assignment use qtcreator from www.qt.io/ and download an empty project from http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106b/cs106b.1172//assnFiles/Blank.zip. 
Extract the zip file, delete the file source.cpp in the src folder and copy the src and res folder to your new folder. Then open the project file Blank.pro with qtcreator. 

See http://stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/ for mor information about the Stanford c++  library.
